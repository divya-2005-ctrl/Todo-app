PROJECT TITLE : "TO-DO APPLICATION"

It is a full-stack project that is built and run entirely in Visual Studio Code, using the following stack:

Frontend : Flutter (runs in chrome)

Backend : Java Spring Boot (gradle)

Database : H2 (in memory,browser-accessible)

How to run the project

1.Open Backend in vscode tab (C:\Users\USER\todo\Backend)

2.Run the Backend by typing gradlew bootRun in terminal

3.Open Frontend in another tab of vscode separately(C:\Users\USER\todo\Frontend)

4.Run the Frontend by typing flutter run in terminal

5.Select option 'Chrome' to display the project

6.Make sure both frontend and backend are running

7.Now you can able to add,update,delete in todo application

Note : The backend allows all frontend origins for testing in any chrome.Since i got ('allowedOrigins("*")') in my backend [backend\src\main\java\com\todo\todo\config\WebConfig.java].
